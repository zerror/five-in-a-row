# Five-in-a-Row

This is a web version of a classic game called **5-in-a-row**. 

_As you might guess the goal of the game is to get 5 marks in a row before your opponent does._ 

Game was created to showcase use of web related programming languages, techonologies and libraries.

Game currently has following features 
* resizeable game board
* practice mode to play again self
* undo/redo move 
* simple AI opponent
* supports two languages (fi/en)
* remembers state of the board 

Note: UI was not the focus of this implementation. 

Obviously _**HTML, CSS**_ and _**Javascript**_ are part of the implementation. 

**But what else was used?**

You can find the answers by _studying the code_ or by _scrolling_ to the bottom of this page..

In any case feel free to try the game out!

#### Used techonologies

Here are the answers to the question what technologies were used?

> This game was coded using **Node.js** as a backend and **React.js** as a framework.
>
> **ECMAScript 6** javascript features were used as well.  
>
> Translations are handled by **React Intl** library.
>
> Board resizing functionality is provided by **React Resizable** library.
>
> Game state is stored to _Local Storage_.
>
> Code itself is stored in git and it is server by Heroku.

Next steps:
* add multiplayer mode with a lobby and chat
* add leader board to store the player scores
* AI improvements/different difficulty levels
* UI/layout improvements
* mmm beer..
